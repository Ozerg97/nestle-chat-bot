A delightful cup of coffee, period. House Blend is a treat paired with a morning bun or blueberry scone.

The heavy, full body and concentrated herbal spice flavours are the hallmarks of a great Sumatran coffee and a favourite of our most seasoned roasters. Sumatra's heavy mouthfeel and concentrated herbal spice notes pair well with cinnamon, oatmeal, maple, toffee, and cheese. Expertly packed immediately after roasting, Starbucks whole bean coffees are as fresh as the day they were roasted.",
