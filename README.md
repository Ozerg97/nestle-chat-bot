# 🍫 Nestlé Assignment – AI Chatbot with GraphRAG & Vector Search

This project aims to build a smart chatbot capable of answering questions about **madewithnestlé website**, using a hybrid approach combining **vector search**, **graph-based knowledge retrieval (GraphRAG)**, and **LLM-based generation** via **Gemini (Vertex AI)**.

## 🧠 Overview

The system combines:
- **Semantic search** using vector embeddings
- **Graph reasoning** using Neo4j Aura 
- **LLM-based response generation** using Google's Gemini model

This allows the chatbot to answer complex queries like:
> “Give me a recipe with Smarties that contains no nuts.”
